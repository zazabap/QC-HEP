\section{Your research topic in Japan:
Describe articulately the research you wish
to carry out in Japan.}
\textbf{Research theme:} Quantum Computing Algorithms for 
Machine Learning and Signal Processing.  \newline 
\newline
Quantum Computing was postulated in the early 1980s as way to 
perform computations that would not be tractable with a classical 
computer. Currently, at Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
era, 50 to hundreds of qubits are available for algorithm designs \cite{aps_review}.
In 2019, Google built quantum processor, Sycamore processor, 
with programmable superconducting qubits to create quantum states on 
53 qubits, which also experimentally demonstrated the realization of 
quantum supremacy \cite{qc_supremacy}.
So far, companies like D-wave implemented quantum computers specialized 
quantum annealing and Xanadu implemented Photonic Quantum Computers with 
216 qubits available. 
 Within decades of research, a universal fault-tolerant 
quantum computer that can solve efficiently problems such 
as integer factorization and unstructured database search using 
millions of qubits are expected to be developed \cite{qml_hep}. 
Meanwhile, many quantum algorithms have already been  
developed with the aim at exploiting the capacity of the 
hardware for machine learning and signal processing application. 
The research I would like to carry out at Tokyo institute of Technology
is the development of the quantum computing algorithms, which could 
exponentially increase the computational speed compared to classical 
algorithms. I expect the study of such 
quantum algorithms in machine learning and signal processing 
using large Hilbert space may bring various perspective 
in the field of Information and Communication Engineering. \textbf{Latest Update:}
The IBM Quantum System Two will have a remarkable 16,632 qubits 
system in Late 2023 revealed. \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQjKUN8PORM}{Youtube Link}!

\textbf{Notations Clarification: }\newline 1. Hilbert space: in quantum mechanics, 
the state of a physical system is represented by a vector in 
a \textit{Hilbert space}: a complex vector space with an inner product. \newline
2. \textit{Dirac notation} is used to represent the vectors in the 
Hilbert space, denoted by $\ket{v}$, called ket, where $v$ is 
some symbol which identifies the vector. One could equally well 
use something like $\overrightarrow{v}$ or $\text{\textbf{v}}$. A 
multiple of a vector by a complex number $c$ is written as 
$c\ket{v}$ $\implies$ think of it as analogous to $c \overrightarrow{v}$ 
or $c \text{\textbf{v}}$. \newline 3. In Dirac notation the inner 
product of the vectors $\ket{v}$ with $\ket{w}$ is written as $\braket{v}{w}$. 
This resembles the ordinary dot product $\overrightarrow{v} \cdot \overrightarrow{w}$, 
thus think of $\overrightarrow{v}^{*} \cdot \overrightarrow{w}$.

\subsection{Prior Literature and Current Development on Quantum Computing Algorithms}

\textbf{Quantum Machine Learning} Machine learning has been used in various fields for a long time, 
with algorithms like BDT, CNN, GAN and etc developed for classification and image recognition task. 
With advancement in Quantum Computers, an interesting question is whether there are efficient 
quantum machine learning algorithms could approach or outperform the 
existing machine learning algorithms on classical computers. 
Recent years, the robust development of quantum computing has also brought people 
Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC), Quantum Kernel Methods \cite{qml_kernel} \cite{qml_kernel2}, 
Variational Shadow Quantum Learning (VSQL)\cite{qml_vsql}, and Quantum Generative 
Adversarial Network (Quantum-GAN) \cite{qc_qgan}.

  % region will be the algorithms run on the

  % and parameters update will still complete by the 
  % classical computers. Thus, many people identify such 
  % Quantum Machine Learning algorithms as 
  % Hybrid/Semi-classical quantum algorithms

\end{figure}

These new approaches solve 
the clustering, classification, discrimination problems with
Quantum Computing Algorithm. Most of them take advantages of exponential 
improvement in computational speed of quantum computer and are expected 
to have better performance than the classical version of algorithms. 
The VQC shown in Figure \ref{vqcc} demonstrated to 
approximate the Deep Reinforcement Learning for decision-making 
and policy-selection \cite{ieee_vqc}. 

\textbf{Quantum Signal Processing}
The Fourier transform occurs in many different classical computing 
fields, especially signal processing. The decompose of wave from 
silicon detectors, image processing from CMOS detector, the noise filtering
and more all require use of Fourier Transform. Borrowed from Qiskit's notation, 
the classical discrete Fourier Transforms
act on vector $x = (x_0, x_1,...,x_n)$ and its mapping to vector $y = (y_0, y_1,...,y_n)$
according to formula:
\begin{equation}
  y_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} x_j \omega_N^{jk}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_N^{jk} = e^{2\pi i \frac{jk}{N}}$. The quantum Fourier 
transform is the quantum implementation of the discrete Fourier 
transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction. It is part of 
many quantum algorithms, most notably Shor's factoring algorithm \cite{qc_Shor_1997}
and quantum phase estimation \cite{qc_phase_estimation}. Similar to discrete Fourier 
transform, the quantum state $ \ket{X} = \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} x_j \ket{j} $ and its mapping to 
$ \ket{Y} = \sum^{N-1}_{k=0} y_k \ket{k} $
and the map could therefore be expressed as the summation of state 
or multiplication of the unitary matrix:
\begin{equation}
  \ket{j}  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} \omega_N^{jk} \ket{k} \implies
  U_{QFT}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum^{N-1}_{j=0} \sum^{N-1}_{k=0}  \omega_N^{jk} \ket{k} \bra{j}
\end{equation}
There are already well published paper and books for quantum Fourier transform \cite{qc_book}.

\subsection{Motivation for working on Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum Signal Processing}

\textbf{Quantum Machine Learning:}  Before the robust 
development of machine learning, people question about 
what to do with machine learning. Now it turns similar 
question to quantum machine learning. What is the advantages of 
quantum version of machine learning over the classical 
machine learning in data analysis? What is the benefit 
if one just "translate" the classical algorithm? 
If current quantum algorithms could 
solve some problems, is there any quantum algorithm that have 
better performance? In exploration of these questions, we need 
to study various possibilities of QML framework with the 
existing approach. 
One interesting way for exploration is to 
combine quantum machine learning algorithms with Manifold Learning. 
For example, in Riemannian Manifold, 
reproducing Kernel Hilbert space(RKHS)
plays important role in extracting the 
features. Also in quantum kernel method, RKHS is also 
formed for input data before processing in 
the quantum circuit for further learning \cite{qml_kernel}. 
The shared procedure provides idea to improve the existing 
algorithms using Riemannian Manifold and combine it to 
quantum kernel method, either deriving the completely new algorithm for 
clustering and feature extraction or 
improving the existing clustering algorithms using Manifold, which
would be quite interesting work to explore \cite{qml_ibm} \cite{qml_ibm2}. 

\textbf{Quantum Signal Processing:} 
Moreover, with quantum Fourier transform, could we benefit from 
formation of Hilbert space in quantum computer and bring it to 
signal processing field and more? Could we actually prove the 
universal advantages of quantum computing algorithms over the 
classical algorithms in signal processing as Shor's algorithm? 
These questions lead us to the discussion below: \newline
1. \textbf{QFT ready Original Signal State } One important question is:
\textit{
Can we use the quantum Fourier transform to speed up the 
computation of the Fast Fourier Transform or Discrete Fourier Transform?} 
In Issac Chuang's book, he considered the amplitude in a quantum 
computer cannot be directly accessed by measurement. Moreover, Chuang 
thinks there is no way of determining the Fourier transformed 
amplitudes of the original states. However, in image processing field, 
different Quantum Image Representation were proposed and some quantum analog 
representation of classical images is demonstrated. Such progress in recent 
year motivates me to rethink about the possible application of QFT in 
signal processing.\newline
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{qft2.png}
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{qft1.png}
  \caption{The quantum Fourier Transform Circuit for 3 qubits only and 
  n different qubits}
\end{figure}
2. \textbf{Efficiency Improvement} The Shor's algorithm is a 
quantum computer algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. 
Shor's algorithm runs polynomial time and allows us to find prime decomposition of very big 
numbers in $O ((log N)^3)$. One of the important factors such algorithm is so efficient is 
due to the efficiency of quantum Fourier transform. The discrete Fourier transform on 
$2^n$ amplitudes can be implemented as quantum circuit consisting of only $O(n^2)$ Hadamard gates
and controlled phase shift gates using n qubits. Compared with discrete Fourier transform, 
which takes $O(n 2^n )$ bits in classical computer. \underline{Such exponentially improvement 
efficiency using quantum Fourier transform}, motivates me to think how to apply this 
to imaging processing, noise filtering and more. With more detailed study on 
classical algorithms in signal processing, the exploration of quantum 
Fourier transforms and formation of quantum signal processing framework based on 
this idea would be really interesting. \newline
\textbf{Conclusion:} In general the content above is strongly correlated with background of the research 
I would like to carry out in Japan. The detailed research method and ultimate goals 
will be included in the next question. 


\newpage
\section{Study program in Japan:
(Describe in detail and with specifics - particularly
concerning the ultimate goal(s) of your research in Japan)
}

\subsection{Research Objectives}
The ultimate target is to develop breakthrough algorithms
 in quantum machine learning and quantum signal processing. 
Especially in quantum machine learning, 
finding the one outperforms current classical machine learning 
algorithms in a specific task would be one of the ultimate goals for 
researchers in this field. Quite commonly observed, 
the quantum algorithms have better performance than the classical algorithms when 
data sample is low \cite{qml_hep} \cite{qml_vsql}. When the dataset is large, classical 
algorithm has better performance in accuracy than the current quantum algorithms. 
In quantum signal processing part, I wish to 
develop algorithms using quantum Fourier transform to 
complete tasks considered not possible in the past. Therefore, the 
objectives below come to the table:
\textbf{
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Manifold Learning Algorithms 
  \item Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum Fourier Convolutional Neural Network
  % \item Quantum Signal Processing: Encoding Theory 
\end{enumerate}
}
A. The existing Kernel or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space in 
the Riemann Manifold Method will be enhanced or improved 
models for data analysis using Quantum Kernel Method. Combination of these two algorithms
could possibly solve the clustering problems in Riemannian Manifold 
and improve the time and space exponentially. 

B. In imaging analysis, Fourier transform is definitely an unavoidable technique. 
Some algorithms analyze the data in Fourier Space and transform them back to real 
space to extract the features \cite{fourier}.
In analog signal processing, we could not apply the quantum Fourier transform. However,
similar to the phase estimation algorithms. We could try to set neural network 
as "phase" to use QFT and inverse QFT for estimation the parameters. 
Later, several goals for working on Quantum Fourier Transform and its application in 
Quantum Convolutional Neural Network listed below\cite{qml_fcnn}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Forming algorithms could possibly enhance the classical
  discrete Fourier transform. Such replacement may improve classical
  algorithms to achieve better performance in feature extraction, 
  like noise filtering, image processing and etc.
  \item By the theory of Big-O, the quantum Fourier transform is exponentially
  faster than classical discrete Fourier transform. Verification the efficiency 
  improvement adding Quantum Fourier Transform to existing quantum 
  algorithms would also be a nice work to get started. 
\end{enumerate}

% C. Encoding is essential for quantum computing. Before precossing data 
% into the variational quantum circuit, or any type of quantum circuit, 
% encoding of data using angle encoding or amplitude encoding are mandatory. 
% The efficient encoding algorithm is considered as side product of research 
% in quantum machine learning and the quantum signal processing. 

\subsection{Reseaerch Method}
With motivation in last section, the method to achieve 
research objectives will be explained in more details. 

\textbf{Quantum Kernel Method} Among all the 
Quantum Machine learning algorithms, Quantum Kernel 
Method plays an important role for classification problem using 
large dimension of quantum Hilbert space. Traditionally, 
kernel methods for machine learning 
are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, 
with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method 
for classification problems \cite{svm}. 
In kernel methods, the access to the feature space is facilitated 
through kernels or inner products of feature vectors. 
In quantum computing, access to the Hilbert space of quantum states
 is given by measurements, which can also be expressed 
 by inner products of quantum states. \cite{qml_kernel2}
 \begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{kernel2.png}    
  \end{center}
  \caption{Overview of the link between quantum models 
  and kernel methods.}
\end{figure}
There are limitations to the successful 
solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, 
and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. 
Then, people start to think of computational speed-ups afforded by 
quantum algorithms. The exploitation of an exponentially 
large quantum state space through controllable 
entanglement and interference could resolve current limitations. 

\textbf{Clustering Problems in Riemannian Manifolds}
Currently in Machine Learning and Signal Processing field, 
people study the learning from data/features which 
Numerous well-known features in signal processing 
and machine learning belong to Riemannian manifolds, like 
correlation matrices, orthogonal matrices, fixed rank linear 
subspaces and etc \cite{manifold1}. 
Many learning tasks could be studied with forming feature 
space and Riemannian Manifold. The state clustering, 
connectivity among network nodes that stays fixed over a 
time interval. The community detection, subgroup detection 
of nodes within a single state/layer. Subnetwork-sequence 
clustering, sequence of subgroups of nodes with changing state. 
The algorithms study benefits understanding of the brain networks 
and its relation with Alzheimer disease, autism, depression and more \cite{manifold1}.

\textbf{Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Manifold Learning Algorithm}
In practice, the feature space's demensionality 
sometimes can be extremely large. While not 
tackling these feature vectors directly, we 
implicitly analyze the feature vectors by 
only accessing their inner products in the 
feature space, which gives the classical kernel functions K(,). With SVM, a given dataset 
$T = \{ (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_m, y_m)\}$ in $Z_2$, and 
a hyperplane $(w,b)$, a SVM can assign labels through
signs of the decision function, $ y_{\text{pred}}$:
\begin{equation}
  K(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_j)^T \phi(x_i) \ \ , \ \ y_{\text{pred}} = \text{sign} ( <w,x> +b)
\end{equation}
Also, separation by mapping them into a feature space
is another solution, where $y_{pred} = sign( <w', \phi(x)> +b')$ and 
$w' = \sum_i \alpha_i \phi(x_i)$. with Lagrangian multipliers 
$\alpha_i$. Then, under constraints $\alpha_i \leq 0 $ and 
$\sum_i y_i \alpha_i = 0$, we can compute the optimal 
$\alpha_i^{*}$, thus the optimal hyperplane by maximizing: 
$
  \sum_i \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i, j} \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j 
  \phi(x_j)^T \phi(x_i)
$
Then, we only need the inner product of feature 
vectors $\phi(x_j)^T \phi(x_i) = K(x_i, x_j)$, which is the above 
mentioned kernel function. With such idea, $y_{\text{pred}}$ is: 
\begin{equation}
  y_{ \text{pred}} = \text{sign} ( \sum_i \alpha_i^* K(x,x') +b')
\end{equation}
With the idea of classical methods, the essentials of 
quantum kernel methods are the same, if we map a 
classical data vector x into quantum state $\ket{\phi(x)}$
by encoding circuit $U(x)$ and the quantum kernel 
function is the inner products of 
two quantum feature vectors in the Hilbert space:
\begin{equation}
  U(x) \ket{0^{N}} = \ket{\phi(x)} \implies  
  K^Q_{ij} = |\bra{\phi(x_j)} \ket{\phi(x_i) }|^2 = |\bra{0^{\bigotimes N}} U^{\dagger}(x_j) U(x_i) \ket{ 0^{\bigotimes N }} |^2
\end{equation}
This kind of kernel manipulation could then feed into 
the common VQC learning method mentioned previously.
and then go through the training as the circuit below. 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{kernel.png}    
  \end{center}
  \caption{Simple two qubits demo for quantum circuit in kernel method}
\end{figure}
% One consideration is the number of 
% qubit and the Hilbert space's dimensionality. 
% The Hilbert space's dimensionality grows exponentially 
% with the number of qubits, nearly all quantum states
% will be perpendicular to each other when we have a large 
% number of qubits. The kernel matrix will converge 
% to identity matrix $K_{ij} = K(x_j,x_i) ~ I$, 
% and the kernel methods fail. One solution here is 
% to extract the "features" from Hilbert space and 
% then construct the kernel function with 
% these extracted features. The projected quantum 
% kernel is therefore proposed: 
% \begin{equation}
%   K^P (x_i,x_j) = exp(-\gamma \sum_k \sum_{p \in M} 
%   (Tr(P \rho(x_i)_k)-Tr(P \rho(x_j)_k))^2)
% \end{equation}
% where $\rho(x_i)_k$ the reduce density matrix of 
% qubits $k$ , $M$ a set of measurements on 
% the reduce density matrix. 
Then, the idea for combination of 
the Quantum Kernel Method in RKHS with the
Fast Sequential Clustering in Riemannian Manifolds will be 
illustrated.

\textbf{Combine with Algorithms on Manifold}
In paper Fast Sequential Clustering in Riemannian
manifolds for Dynamic and Time-series-Annotated Multilayer Networks \cite{manifold1}, this
work focus on building a sequential-clustering framework able to address
a wide variety of clustering tasks in dynamic multilayer (brain) networks
via the information extracted from their nodal time-series.
I consider two essential algorithms are here:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item feature extraction from time-series
  \item Riemannian Manifolds
\end{enumerate}
This work claims that the rich geometry of 
(not necessarily embedded in Euclidean spaces) Riemannian manifolds 
allows latent feature patterns to unfold to the benefit of all of 
the aforementioned network-clustering tasks \cite{manifold1}.
Based on the idea we introduce here, it shows new possibilities to 
work on Manifold Learning and Analysis. In usual Manifold Learning 
theory or Manifold Regularization problem, one's observed data lie on a 
low-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space \cite{manifold2}. 
We could possible define the new algorithm based on this feature: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define the manifold, submanifold and their dimensions
  \item Construct Graphs based on the manifold \cite{manifold3}. 
  \item Calculate the Laplacian of the data graph and form 
        appropriate Kernel function in VQC. 
  \item Optimized the regularized objective function (Loss function)
\end{enumerate} 
% The Grassmanian $Gr(\rho, M)$ is defined as the collection 
% of all linear subspaces fo $R^M$ with rank equal to $\rho$. 
% Motivated by the success of kernel methods in capturing 
% non-linearities in data, user could define RKHS $H$ with its associated
% reproducing kernel function $\kappa(*,*)$ and the mapping 
% could extract features from the Grassmanian $Gr(\rho, M)$. In such 
% algorithm, Kernel correlations 
% $K_v^{(l)}[t] = \phi_v^{(l)} \bigotimes_H \phi_v^{(l)}$ itself 
% as a feature in Riemannian manifold of $P(S)D(T_w)$ of 
% positive-(semi)definite matrices, of dimension $T_W (T_W+1)/2$,
% to take advantages of the rich Riemannian Geometry of $P(S)D(T_w)$

% With proper study of the quantum kernel method, the kernel relation 
% here could be possibly replace with $
%   K^P (x_i,x_j) = exp(-\gamma \sum_k \sum_{p \in M} 
%   (Tr(P \rho(x_i)_k)-Tr(P \rho(x_j)_k))^2)
% 


We could try to bring the low dimensional data to higher dimension 
then form graph and process through the quantum computer. 
Based on processing 
result through quantum kernel method, the features could be well 
discovered through time interval or more.
% It could expect that in 
% the future, applications facing large-scale networks and data, e.g., very long 
% nodal time-series, if the quantum kernel method is computationally efficient clustering 
% framework. 
 Quantum kernel method could operates together 
on data and features 
and carries through all of the network clustering tasks on 
manifolds. For technical details like dimension conversion and Laplacian 
of a graph, demos are shown in the Figure \ref*{ppp}. The Quantum Manifold 
Learning here is suppose to work in field of semi-supervised learning.

  and experiment effect

\textbf{Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum Fourier Transform and Image Processing}\newline
The structure for the development of Quantum Signal Processing starts from
measurement. The wave break down by using Fourier transform's quantum analog
part, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). The Quantum Fourier transform could
particularlly decompose into a product of simpler unitary matrices.
With Simple decomposition, the discrete Fourier transform on $2^n$ amplitudes
can be implemented as a quantum circuit consisting of $O(n^2)$ Hadamard
gates and controlled phase shift gates. 


\textbf{Image Processing:} The quantum-analog representation of classical images, the pixel value 
of $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column can be stored as:
$\ket{pixel_{i,j}} = \cos(\frac{\theta_{i,j}}{2}) \ket{0} + 
\sin (\frac{\theta_{i,j}}{2}) \ket{1}$ as formed in \textbf{Qubit Lattice} model.
Other image representations like \textbf{Flexible Representation of 
Quantum Images} (FRQI) exists: 
\begin{equation}
  \ket{I(\theta)} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{i=0}^{2n-1} (sin(\theta_i) \ket{0} + cos(\theta_i)\ket{1}) \ket{i}
\end{equation}
it actually maps each pixel's grayscale value to the amplitude as well as 
captures the corresponding positions in an image and integrate them into 
a quantum state. Where $\theta$ encodes pixel value of the corresponding 
position $\ket{i}$. The FRQI representation maintains a normalized state 
and the representation space decreases exponentially compared to the 
classical image due to the quantum states' superposition effect. 
Moreover, image representation like \textbf{Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation} (NEQR) exists:
\begin{equation}
  \ket{I} = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum^{2^{2n} -1 }_{y=0} \sum^{2^{2n} -1 }_{x=0} \ket{f(y,x)} \ket{y x}
\end{equation}
Such method uses the basis state of a qubit sequence to 
store the grayscale value of every pixel instead of 
probability amplitude encoded in a qubit in FRQI. 
These representations for images provide possible application on 
quantum Fourier transform. There are already some study using quantum kernel 
method to work on classification. If properly organized, edge detection, filtering 
and more could be realized in thoroughly different method from today. The 
data for testing the new algorithm could use public dataset like 
\textbf{MNIST} dataset or \textbf{CIFAR-10} dataset. If the 
overall new algorithm works with exceptional performance, the 
dataset with fMRI could be used. 

More importantly, the Quntum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) exists for 
classification and image processing \cite{qml_cnn}. Parameterized 
QCNN was benchmarked for classical data classification with 
high accuracy and the best case being about 99\% for MNIST and 
about 94\% for Fashion MNIST \cite{qml_cnn1} \cite{qml_cnn2}. 
With combination of QCNN, quantum Fourier Transform, and Quantum 
Representation of Images. Setup of Quantum Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (Q-FCNN)
is possible. The big picture for such algorithm is:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Classical Image Data Encoding to Quantum Image Representation
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item build up kernels for images then convert each kernel to Quantum Representation
    \item Directly take input images to Quantum Representation
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Using Quantum Fourier Transform take Image Representaions to Fourier Space
  \item MERA QCNN take QFT transfered data \cite{qml_cnn_tutorial} \cite{tensorflow}
  \item Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
\end{enumerate}

Here is just one possibility for new quantum algorithm in field of signal processing. Other
simpler models using previously mentioned VQC is also an option.

\textbf{Research Originality:}
Quantum computing and quantum information science became a hot topics in 
recent years. \cite{qml_hep}
Once there is breakthrough on Noise intermediate Scale quantum era NISQ. All 
the research could take the data analysis, machine learning, signal processing 
to next level. Currently, due to availability of quantum computer, most of the 
algorithms research could be performed on super computer and the algorithms 
above could be developed through self defined python packages. 
Moreover, as Tokyo Insitute of Technology has quite strong bond with 
IBM and development of quantum computer, I expect the new methods I provide 
would not only run on the emulators on super computer, but also on latest real 
quantum computers. 

Furthermore, with connection globally, not only using the fMRI data in brain locally 
at Tokyo Institute of Technology, collaboration with people from international 
institute like MIT, University of Chicago, University of Hong Kong, CERN, KEK and 
more are all possible. The clustering algorithms anti-kt is already the 
default on clustering analysis for jets in colliders and there are so 
many possibilities my research could create a new methodology for 
all types of study in natural science and broader human society. 


\section{Present Field of Study}

The pixel hit information plays vital rule for the charge particle track reconstructions,
especially for flavor tagging such as c-, b-quark jets or hadronic tau identifications, where
they form as a colimated spray of the charged particles. The track reconstruction software
has been developed to identify such particles in the dense environment of the very narrow
space using the neural network technique. Meanwhile, the pixel detector has been experienced
significant radiation damage that degradates the performance. The pixel hits will be lost at
most 50\% of efficiency in b-layer in the end of RUN3, in turn lost the performance for the
cluster classification to split or merge the associated cluster in the dense track reconstruction.
The evaluation of the radiation damage of the pixel detector and modeling of the pixel cluster
classification in the simulation is thus critical to improve the systematic uncertainties through
RUN3.
The task devotes to monitor the pixel cluster classification performance using the
$Z \rightarrow \tau \tau$ events. The hadronic tau with 3-prong decay mode is a clean source for the dense
tracking. The task first constructs clean dataset of the $Z \rightarrow \tau \tau$ with 3-prong final state, then
the pixel clustering is compared with the simulation in a various view in term of the radiation
damage. The produced dataset would be useful for many area for the tracking aspect as further
optimization of the neural network training \cite{pixel}.



% \section{Present Field of Study}

% During my undergraduate period, my field of study was Atomic, 
% Molecular and Optical physics. More specifically in optical 
% science, I was exploring the High Harmonic Generation property
%  of various light sources. Instead of commonly seen 2nd and 
%  3rd order harmonic generation for the laser light, the lab
% I worked for is trying to generate light with higher harmonics
% like 30th order, or even higher 4000th order harmonics. 
% In the beginning, the research starts with simulation codes
% (with Matlab) of tunnel ionization to find potential of the
%  perturbed system. Meanwhile, I studied and utilized software
%   engineering techniques (with C\#), some basic circuit 
%   construction and computer vision knowledge to make 
%   a 3D machining station with a femtosecond laser. 
%   The machining station is used for precise fabrication 
%   under micrometers. These tools empower the entire lab 
%   experiment and help with further development. 
% Another field of study I spent my time heavily on is 
% the Condensed Matter Physics. After finishing courses 
% in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, I chose several 
% courses in experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics.
%  For the experimental course, we formed a team of three and 
%  completed research in 10 weeks specialized in analysis of 
%  YBCO superconductors with Raman spectroscopy. For the 
%  theoretical course,  Landau Level, various techniques in 
%  quantum information and some other state-of-art models in 
%  condensed matter physics. All the studies here are trying 
%  to understand the complexity in fundamental physics. 
%  In general, these two fields of studies help me prepare 
%  for hands-on experience in experimental physics and 
%  enough intuition to understand the model proposed in 
%  theoretical physics.

% However, after shifting the field of study after 
% I came to Japan, there are plenty of changes in my 
% field of Study. I started working on the ATLAS 
% experiment and its silicon pixel detector upgrade
%  for High Luminosity LHC. Quite frequently, 
%  we have to consider the detector’s signal from 
%  the fundamental level. Like the photon collides 
%  with the detector, generates electron hole pair 
%  in the semiconductor and data analysis. Here I 
%  improve the high level trigger efficiency of HH to bbtautau 
%  analysis using the Monte Carlo data sample.
 
% Moreover, based on existing data, I start to 
% apply many quantum machine learning algorithms 
% to the Higgs particle signal analysis. Collaborate 
% with researchers from Chicago and Hong Kong, 
% I applied the Variational Quantum Circuit Algorithms[], 
% Variational Shadow Quantum Learning Algorithms[VSQL] and 
% Quantum Kernel Methods to the data obtained from LHC. 
% The experience working on the field of data analysis 
% and some signal processing field makes me interested 
% in working on the more engineering oriented studies.
%  and hopefully I could develop some useful algorithms 
%  or method which could improve the existing signal 
%  processing field. Although I still don't have any 
%  existing publications, next year, within the ATLAS 
%  collaboration, roughly 1~2 papers analyzing the 
%  HH->bbtautau process will be published in Physics Journals 
%  in October 2023.
